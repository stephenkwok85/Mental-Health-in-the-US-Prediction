# Mental-Health-in-the-US-Research

This project investigates how mental health treatment preferences in the U.S. shifted after COVID-19, specifically comparing counseling-based approaches versus prescription-based treatments. Using real-world datasets, we apply data science techniques to explore, analyze, and model trends in treatment adoption, effectiveness, and accessibility.

Project Goals:
- Main Research Question: Can we predict whether an individual will seek mental health care based on demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors? Which factors (e.g., income, age, employment status) most influence the likelihood of seeking mental health care?
- Approach:
  - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations.
  - Apply statistical techniques and visualizations to compare treatment types.
  - Build a predictive supervised learning model to analyze which factors (age, income, region, etc.) influence treatment choice.
  - Discuss the limitations of data and methodology.

Methods:
- Data Science Techniques:
  - EDA to identify patterns, distributions, and correlations in the dataset.
  - Hypothesis testing to discover significant differences between demographic groups
  - Predictive modeling to predict whether an individual sought mental health care based on socioeconomic and demographic factors through trained machine learning models
- Data exploration, modeling, and evaluation:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis
    - Visualize the distributions of key variables
    - Analyze and clean missing data
    - Create heatmaps to understand the relationship between features
    - Identify and handle outliers
- Preprocessing
  - Convert categorical variables into numerical format
  - Normalize numerical variables
  - Handle imbalanced data
- Modeling approach
  - Logistic regression
  - Random forest + Decision trees
  - Neural Networks, if we find them applicable
